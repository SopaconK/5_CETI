Inserting Values: 

When a new key is inserted, it's always inserted at the leaf. 

First we are going to search from the root until we find a leaf, then we're going to put the new value as a child of that leaf.

This steps are followed while we're searching the leaf:

>Start in the root
>Compare the key with the current node
>If the key is less than the the key of the actual node move to the left.
>Else move to the right.
>Repeat until find a leaf.

When you find a leaf, if the new key is less than the value in the leaf, we put the new key in the left else we put the key in the right.


Deleting values: 

We have 3 cases.

Case 1: A leaf node
If we want to delete a leaf node, just delete it and nothing more.

Case 2: A node with a single child

Copy the child into the node and delete the node.

Case 3: A node with both children.

We find the sucessor of the node. Then swap values of the node and the sucessor, and delete the sucessor
